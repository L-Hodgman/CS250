How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

A user's needs can be interpreted by having meetings and interviews with the end users and client. We create user stories for each of these needs to help the developers know what to include in the program's code. User stories also help the developers know exactly how the stakeholders want the program to function. 

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I approach developing programs by looking at what is needed and the workload of the program. In future development I want to use agile processes like delivering a product in increments. This would help lessen the stress of development by not cramming everything in one sitting. Also, it would help with catching errors and function issues sooner.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member means to be respectible, reliable, collaborative, self organizing, and accountable. You are accountable for your own mistakes and work. You are self oraginzing with what you have to get done. Even though you are focused on your work, you are able to be a team player and collaborate with others to build a great product. Your team is able to rely on you to get your work done. Also, you are respectible to others on your team and can build them up, not break them down.
